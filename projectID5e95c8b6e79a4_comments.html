<HTML><BODY>The Monastery of Petschenga is a small booklet containing the history and legends surrounding the world's northernmost orthodox monastery, which was located in Lapland -- part of Finland until 1944, afterwards in the Soviet Union, and now Russia. Although the buildings were destroyed in 1944, it has been rebuild in 1997, for the fifth time in its long, but often interrupted, history.

<p>No particular difficulties here, so have fun!
